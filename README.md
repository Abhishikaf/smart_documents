# Smart Documents: Notarization with IFPS File Storage

This application was conceived to be a means to upload and have access to documents. The additional functionality it implements is blockchain based verification, IFPS (Inter-Planetary File System) based storage, optional encryption, and ability to get documents notarized with payments made through ETH (Ethereum) to a verified notary. The app is implemented with a user interface using Streamlit.

## Technologies and Installation Guide:

This application was written in Python, Solidity, and SQL. It uses the following technologies:

- streamlit

Please verify you have installed all of the requirements.

- The application uses Remix IDE to implement a smart contract. This can be run in the online version on their website.
- The application uses Ganache to simulate an Ethereum payment network. You must install Ganache.
- The application uses Metamask to connect the Ganache test network to the smart contract deployed in Remix IDE.
- The application uses Remix IDE to implement a smart contract. This can be run in the online version on their website.
- The application requires a Pinata account. You will need to acquire a PINATA_API_KEY and PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY.

## Usage:

The app can be run with the command ```streamlit run app.py``` in the application folder.

You will need to start the program Ganache to simulate a local Ethereum network.
