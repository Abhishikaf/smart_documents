# Smart Documents: Notarization with IFPS File Storage

This application was conceived to be a means to upload and have access to documents. The additional functionality it implements is blockchain based verification, IFPS (Inter-Planetary File System) based storage, optional encryption, and ability to get documents notarized with payments made through ETH (Ethereum) to a verified notary. The app is implemented with a user interface using Streamlit.

The application uses a Ganache test network, which is used to test applications to be applied to real Ethereum network transactions.

## Technologies and Installation Guide:

This application was written in Python 3.7, Solidity 0.5.0, and SQL. It uses the following technologies:

- streamlit
- web3
- pandas
- hashlib
- cryptography
- sqlite3
- pinata

Please verify you have installed all of the requirements.

In addition, there are several other programs and accounts that need to be set up:

- The application uses Remix IDE to implement a smart contract. This can be run in the online version on their website.
- The application uses Ganache to simulate an Ethereum payment network. You must install Ganache.
- The application uses Metamask to connect the Ganache test network to the smart contract deployed in Remix IDE. You must install Metamask and set up an account.
- The application requires a Pinata account. You will need to acquire a PINATA_API_KEY and PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY.

In addition, two libraries of functions specific to this application have been written:

- crypto_funcs
- login_funcs

These libraries are included.

## Usage:

This program was designed to use an Ethereum test network simulated by Ganache. Please follow these steps:

You will need to start the program Ganache to simulate a local Ethereum network.

Open the program Metamask and import one or several accounts from the Ganache test network, using their private keys which can be accessed by clicking the key icon to the right of the account.

Open the web application Remix IDE. Upload the smart contract file ```SmartDocument.sol```. 

Compile the contract. Use the compiler version 0.5.0.

Deploy the contract: For the enviornment select Injected Web3 and enter an address displayed on Ganache into the box that says ```At Address```.

Get the contract address by hitting the copy button to the right of the deployed contract.

Create a file named ```.env``` in the application folder. You will need to edit it to look like this:

```
PINATA_API_KEY='yourpinataapikeyhere'
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY='yourpinatasecretkeyhere'
WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=http://127.0.0.1:7545
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xA5637079F4313db0AB0ddb50f50662771A9F3C94
```
Note that the Pinata API Key and Pinata Secret Key are enclosed in single quotes. The Web3 Provider URI will be the RPC Server Address visible in your Ganache application. The Smart Contract Address will be the address copied from the deployed smart contract in your Remix IDE application.

### Running the Program

Once you have followed the above steps, the app can be run with the command ```streamlit run app.py``` in the application folder.




## Future Development:

- Implement DID - Decentralized Identification
- Implement verification of Notary credentials using existing databases
- Allow documents to be signed by multiple parties
- Save user accounts on a decentralized platform
